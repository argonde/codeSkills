**Note**: R is a programming language used for numeric/statistical computing, graphics and data analysis. Unlike python, R's libraries are oriented toward performing specific statistical methods, thus it is not a general-purpose language, but one excellent for numerical computing and visualising statistics. Part of the tasks of a Data Engineer depend not just on which infrastructure to choose, and how to architect it, but also on knowing how to make data ready for processing.
