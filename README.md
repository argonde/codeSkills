* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): A good read for those who want a hands on approach. The [book](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff) contents are available for free on the website, as well as a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=FOR_LIKE_10_BUCKS).

* [CS109 Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/): A comprehensive course from Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. It uses Python to crunch the data.


* [DataCamp Community Tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials): Tutorials, some of which are user-created, on Python, SQL, Git, R & statistics, etc ...

* [Data Processing with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/) A website that provides the foundations of data science, backed by a GitHub repository: [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/). It uses Jupyter Notebooks to load data, analyze and visualize data.

* [Pandas Tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas): It uses free available _Jupyter Notebooks_  to show the fundamentals of python _Pandas_ .

* [Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php): Comprehensive and free tutorial, reaching up to advanced OOP, passing through, _Numerical Python_, to inlcude _Machine Learning_ and _Tkinter_.

* [StatsModels Tutorial](https://github.com/jseabold/tutorial): This is repository of _Jupyter Notebooks_ dealing with the [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) module, for those interested on statistics with Python.

[R](#contents)
---
**Note**: R is a programming language used for numeric/statistical computing, graphics and data analysis. Unlike python, R's libraries are oriented toward performing specific statistical techniques, thus it is not a general-purpose language, but one excellent for numerical computing and visualising statistics. Part of the tasks of a Data Engineer depend on not just which infrastructure to choose, and how to architect it, but also on knowing how to make data ready for processing.

* [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/): Swirl is actually an R package that allows you to learn R interactively in the R console. Some prefer using RStudio for writing R code.

* [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) A DataCamp introduction to R basics.

* [DataCamp Community Tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials): Tutorials, some of which are user-created, on Python, SQL, Git, R & statistics, etc ...

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) An R introduction to data science and the very well impremented data "tidy" approach in R. This training is structured into the 5 natural steps taken when working with data: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, and Communicate. It does good use of the R libraries _dplyr_, _tidyr_, and _ggplot2_. Also available as a book.

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) Yet another website based on a book. It introduces the more advanced features of the R language, e.g. style, exception handling, functional programming, R's C interface, etc ...

* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science): A comprehensive, challenging, 10-part course from Johns Hopkins University & Coursera. Covers R, the data science workflow, stats, and some machine learning.

* [R Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/): A basic intro to R and stats from the University of Georgia, Department of Mathematics.

* [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3): Semester-long course from MIT & edX. Covers stats/DS using real-world examples.

* [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/): A website dedicated to helping individuals with some background in statistics transition to R.
